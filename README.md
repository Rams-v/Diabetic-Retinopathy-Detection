## Introduction
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, potentially leading to vision impairment or even blindness if left untreated. Timely detection and intervention are crucial in preventing the progression of this condition. The "Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection" project aims to address this challenge by leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.
The primary goal of our application is to analyze retina fundus images and identify signs of Diabetic Retinopathy. By extracting crucial segments from these images and employing a robust classification model, we can provide a reliable tool for early diagnosis and intervention. Early detection allows for timely medical assistance, helping to mitigate the impact of Diabetic Retinopathy on patients' vision.
This project not only contributes to the field of medical diagnostics but also aligns with the broader objective of leveraging technology for proactive healthcare. The automated detection provided by our application has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in their diagnosis, making the process more efficient and accessible.
As we move forward, the following sections will delve into the technical aspects of the project, including the folder structure, preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, classification models, and the achieved results. We invite contributors and users to explore, collaborate, and enhance the capabilities of this Diabetic Retinopathy detection system.
